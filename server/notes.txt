When starting a backend end server from scratch:
- install prisma using the quick start guide
   - model the data on prisma then migrate the dev (npx prisma migrate dev)

- after then create a seed file where you can create the prisma dummy database

- then after you write your seed queries in your seed file, run your seed file through `npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts`

-then to double check `npx prisma studio` is the information is seeded from the query

What I learned so far:
-when I am creating a backend using prisma, do the quick start guide, then 
- create the REST endpoints in the server/app file then implement the prisma create, change, get, and delete functions using express js
- Used middleware zod for variables typescripting to prevent extensive if statements for typeof string
- also used the coffeeRouter to route the coffee and tied it back to server.ts
   - when creating the router, don't put the endpoint until it is being used in the server and in the router use the "/" and have the end point "/coffee", for example, in the server.ts
   -naming convention for router is name.router.ts
-next i would go to middleware video and write down error handling to prevent the server shutdown if there is an error
-next i would try to implement the JWT token/ Bcrypt with zod
-then I would try to connect the backend server to communicate the frontend server
