WHen starting a backend end server:
- install prisma using the quick start guide
   - model the data on prisma then migrate the dev

- after then create a seed file where you can create the prisma dummy database

- then after you write your seed queries in your seed file, run your seed file through `npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts`

-then to double check `npx prisma studio` is the information is seeded from the query




What I learned so far:
-when I am creating a backend using prisma, do the quick start guide, then 
- create the REST endpoints in the server/app file then implement the prisma create, change, get, and delete functions using express js
-next i would try to implement the JWT token/ Bcrypt with zod
-then I would try to connect the backend server to communicate the frontend server
